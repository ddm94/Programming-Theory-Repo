Submission 2 for Jr. Programmer Pathway

An extremely simple project demonstrating OOP principles using three objects:

   - There are three different colored shapes that inherit from a base “shape” class (inheritance).
   - When you click on each shape, it prints something different to the screen through an overridden DisplayText() function (polymorphism).
   - Each shape contains data, such as its name or color, which are stored as properties with getters and setters (encapsulation).
   - Code is organized in a way that reduces duplicate code through higher level methods (abstraction).
